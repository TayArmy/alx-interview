# Prime Game

Determining the winner of a prime game where:

- Given a set of consequitive integers starting from 1 up to and including n, 2 players take turns choosing a prime number from the set `(1 - n)` and removing that number and its multiples from the set.
- The player that cannot make a move loses that round of the game
- They play `x` rounds of the game, where `n` may be different for each round

Return the player with the most wins per game

Note: _Player1 always starts the game and Player2 follows._
